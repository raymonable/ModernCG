## What is this?

**ModernCG** is a semi-replacement for CoreGui, designed for Synapse (or Scriptware).

### Note:
This is fairly unfinished. Some parts of the CoreGui haven't been replaced, or have compatibility issues. Please report any major bugs or missing guis!

## How do I install it?

1. In Synapse X, go to `Options` and make sure `Auto-Launch` and `Internal UI` is on.
2. Download [init.lua](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raymonable/ModernCG/main/init.lua) from the repository. Do not use anything from the Releases tab.
3. Put the downloaded `init.lua` into your `autoexec` Synapse X folder.
4. Launch a game, and it should download the required resources for **ModernCG**.

**ModernCG** automatically updates, so you'll only have to do this once.

## Known issues / Known constraints

- Updates will shutdown the client as it starts.
- Teams don't show up, nor are organized on PlayerList.
- Whenever a player's character is spawned, their position on both playerlists are pushed to the back.
- Voice chat settings cannot be modified.
- The `RBXM` file is not hashed or checked yet (for security reasons).
- Not all icons and assets have been ported to `synassets`.
- The viewport playerlist can cause lots of lag on large servers.

***AND NO, I AM NOT CONFESSING TO OWNING SYNAPSE. TECH, IF YOU SEE THIS, THEN YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT I DON'T OWN IT!!!***
